### What I learned

The hero background image is surprisingly challenging. I tried flexbox and background image style back and forth, trying to place the image top right without breaking for responsiveness.

In the end flexbox worked, with making the image container itself a flexbox and scaling up the image inside by 115%. The container with basis of 400px will flexgrow and scale the image inside it.
